## Introduction
This project is centred around: 
1. Application of supervised and unsupervised learning in data analysis
2. Computer vision application in image processing,

## Background
In the supervised learning we build a regression model that predicts the CO2 emissions from vehiles given features of the vehicle type such as model year, make, vehicle class, engine size, fuel type, fuel consumption etc. We compare different supervised models, perform fine tuning of hyperparaments, score the models performance and make predictions on unseen data.

Computer vision project involves building a convolutional neural network that can classify a vehicle as emergency vehicle or not base on features learnt by the convolutional layers. Issues of model overfitting or underfitting are taken into consideration and regularisation is done to ensure model generalises well on test data.
