## Introduction
This project is designed to evaluate the ability to read and write file formats of common
types used in Data Science, and to manipulate complex data into different representations.
The tasks provided here are indicative of Data Pre-processing workloads which are common
to all Data Science projects. 

## Background
You have been given a collection of data from a company wishing to process its customer
records for business purposes (acw_user_data.csv). The existing systems in-place at the
company only export to a CSV file, and this is not in an appropriate format for analysis. You
have been given the task of preparing this data for further analyses by your colleagues
within the company, including representation changes, filtering, and deriving some new
attributes / metrics for them.

The data include attributes such as first name, second name, credit card number, marital
status, and even contains data on the customerâ€™s car.


## Skills acquired
- reading in csv file 
- detecting data errors and cleaning
- write files to json
- visualizing data
